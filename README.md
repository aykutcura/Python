### Uber Data Analysis
This data is from 2016 single Uber user which I have found on Kaggle website. 
Imported libraries are **pandas**, **numpy**, **datetime**, **matplotlib**, **matplotlib.pylot**, **seaborn**, **calendar**.
I used bar charts to indicate the data based on which locations he had been, frequency of using uber, trip frequency between two locations. 
Please see **Uber Data Analysis** title under Python repository for further details.
